# ClockApp

ClockApp is a customizable, Java-based analog clock application built with Swing.
It supports theming via JSON-defined clock faces that control the look and feel
of the clock: clock face, hour hand, minute hand, second hand.

The project is designed as both a lightweight utility and a playground for experimenting with UI customization in Java. You can load different clock styles at runtime, making it easy to switch between minimal, retro, neon, or experimental faces.
## Features
- ðŸ•’ Analog Clock Rendering â€“ Smooth drawing of hour, minute, and second hands using Swing.
- ðŸŽ¨ Custom Styles with JSON â€“ Define clock faces declaratively (polygons, text, rectangles, and circles).
- ðŸ”„ Live Updates â€“ Clock redraws in real time with system time.
- ðŸ§© Extensible Design â€“ Add new styles easily by dropping a JSON definition into the styles folder.
- ðŸ’» Lightweight â€“ Runs anywhere Java runs, with no external dependencies beyond Gson.

## Why ClockApp?

This project is both a functional desktop clock and an educational example of how to:
- Work with Java Swing graphics including JTimers and non-rectangular JWindows.
- Use JSON-driven design for flexible UI rendering.
- Explore creative visualizations (traditional faces, futuristic designs, or playful experiments).
